# Multilayer Perceptron

![MLP](/materials/gif.gif)

Implementation of a basic multilayer perceptron.

In this project i made multilayer perceptron in graph and matrix variations and compare them.

You can draw latin letter in left part of my app and neuro will predict that letter.

I used multithread programming for some things, QT for UI part.

You can train my neuronetwork, run tests or crossvalidation, also you can change number of hidden layers, type of perceptron, load and save weights.

All you need is run make, make install from src directory, after that you will see MLP folder on your desktop.
